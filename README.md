Deliverable 3: Submission on del3 branch

Note: Bugs are being tracked and will be pushed with the Readme file on Github.

Please refer to deliverable 2 for playing instructions below.
For this deliverable the team equally divided the work. We made groups of 2. 1 group implemented premium squares and 1 group implemented the AI player. After each task was completed we swapped the tasks and tested each other groups features and fixed bugs while also implementing more test cases. The game compiles and runs well.

Deliverable 2: Submission on del2 branch

Note: Bugs are being tracked and will be pushed with the Readme file on Github. 

How to play the Game?
You have to drag the tile from the Rack to the board where you want to place it. 
Once you place the tiles in order you press the 'Check' button to check if your word is valid. If word is valid the box will turn green. If not valid it will turn grey. You are then allowed to "Right Click" on the tile placed on the board (greyed out) to send it back to the rack. You have limited reroll and pass turns allowed. Hard coded to 3 turns right now.

There are bugs in this game which we are working on to fix. The game should be compilable and should run successfully. If any problems are faced please reach out to us as the game runs on all our devices.
